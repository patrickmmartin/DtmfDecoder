# DTMFDecoder

## Overview 

A DTMF decoder I wrote a long time ago.

## Approach

This was part of a suite of components written in Delphi to implement a real time survey tool.

The style is pretty much "of its era" Delphi, if a little pointer oriented.

A couple of interesting points are:

+ use of the Intel NSP library
+ choice of the Goertzel function to detect tones, over (say) FFT 

## Technology

Originally Delphi 5 / C++ Builder 5
